# TIY Projects
In 12 short weeks in the summer of 2015, I became a programmer. I quit my job in marketing and enrolled in The Iron Yard's 12-week Front End Engineering program. These are the projects I worked on in that class, exactly as I left them when I graduated. I am keeping them here not only as a reminder of how much I've grown as a developer, but because sometimes we all need a good laugh.
